# Creating a 3D shape atlas using deformetrica
[Deformetrica](https://www.deformetrica.org/) is an open-source tool that allows comparison of shape objects, performing tasks such as shape registration, atlas construction, and geodesic regression. This tutorial walks through the Deterministic Atlas procedure which, given a set of shapes, determines a "mean" or template shape, and deformation from this template to the individual shapes. For more information, please refer to the deformetrica [documentation](https://gitlab.com/icm-institute/aramislab/deformetrica/-/wikis/home).

### System Requirements:
1. Linux or Mac OS
2. Python(v.3.8) and Anaconda (Python package management system) installed, [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installation recommended if not already installed.
3. [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/): for visualising results, can display VTK files and quickly show animations
4. (Optional) Access to a GPU to speed up performance
5. (Optional) [MeshLab](https://www.meshlab.net/): for cleaning mesh files
6. (Optional) [MITK](https://www.mitk.org/wiki/The_Medical_Imaging_Interaction_Toolkit_(MITK)): if you need to place landmarks

### Data Requirements:
Deformetrica requires coarsley aligned '.vtk' mesh files. This tutorial starts from the object of interest already segmented from scans and saved as 3D mesh files. Please use a segmentation software of your choice to export as mesh file (preferably a VTK file, but can convert from STL or PLY), most have an option for this. Or, if you have '.nii.gz' segmentations, you can follow the tutorial at the bottom to batch export all of your scans to mesh files.

Once you have your objects saved as mesh files, you can start from the following places:
- Mesh files need cleaning and decimating: go to 'Mesh Cleaning' section below
- Mesh files not '.vtk': go to step 1
- Mesh files not aligned: go to step 2
- Mesh files aligned and saved as '.vtk': go to step 3

### Getting Started:
1. Clone this repository to a local directory.

2. Create a new conda environment and install required packages using **`requirements.txt`**.
Open a terminal and run the following commands:\
a. Create the environment: `conda create --name ShapeAtlas python=3.8` \
b. Activate the environment `conda activate ShapeAtlas` \
c. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Organize your file stucture (see below).

4. Set-up your config file:
    - Each python script has an optional '--config' command line argument, if the config file is not in the default location or has a different name. 


### Main Tutorial:

#### 1. Convert mesh files to `.vtk` files:
    - Ensure all of your mesh files are in one folder, and saved as PLY or STL files.
    - Open a terminal and run `python preprocessing/convert.py --input inputfolder --type filetype`, 
    where input folder is the folder with your mesh files, and filetype is the type of file to convert from ('stl' or  'ply')
    - Files will be converted and saved in the input folder.


#### 2. Align mesh files:
    - If mesh files are not scaled and aligned, place a few landmarks on each mesh file (not many needed for coarse alignment; usually 5-10 evenly distributed around the object). Landmarks should have point correspondence between objects and placed in the same order on every object.
    - There are many software options for placing landmarks, but [MITK](https://www.mitk.org/wiki/The_Medical_Imaging_Interaction_Toolkit_(MITK)) is open-source, allows input of VTK mesh files, and export of MPS landmark files.
    - Save your landmark files with the same sample name as your corresponding mesh file and as a 'mps' file. It is important your filenames closely match (adding padding zeroes if you have double digit sample numbers!) or the alignment will not work properly.
    - Run `python preprocessing/align.py [--config configfile] `
    - The meshes will be aligned and scaled, and then saved in the "experiment" directory specified in the config file. 
    - This will also create an 'initial_template.vtk' that is simply
    

#### 3. Create deformetrica files:
    - Open up the 'parameters.csv' file to specify the parameters for your model run. This is what will mainly control how well the deformation works. Important parameters to alter:
        - expname: enter the experiment name that is in your config file
        - object_id: the name of the objects that you are morphing
        - object_kernel_width and deformation_kernel_width: these are the parameters that will most impact your morphing. It will impact the number of control points on the surface, and thus how detailed your morphing is. Too large a number and there will be only a few control points, and overall movement in your shapes, not detailed movement. Too small and there will be small changes on the surface of your mesh files, but not an overall shift. Generally, the advice is to start it at 1/5 the size of your ??? then shift from there.
        - noise_std: how noisy the morphing is, generally set from 0.1 - 1
        - max_iterations and convergence_tolerance: these are related to the optimisation procedure and will determine when the model will stop running, with inital_step_size setting the progression at the start of the model.
        - template: specify one of your objects or another object as a template file, typically one that is close to an average of your objects is best
        - additional parameter details are available [here](https://gitlab.com/icm-institute/aramislab/deformetrica/-/wikis/3_user_manual/3.4_optimization_parameters_xml_file)
    - Run `python create_files.py [--config configfile]`.
    - The following xml files will be saved in your experiment folder:
        - model.xml: specifies the type of model, the kernel-width, object type, and template
        - data_set.xml: list of all of the objects to be included in the model
        - optimization_parameters.xml: parameters used in the model optimization procedure

#### 4. Run deformetrica
    - Navigate into your experiment directory.
    - Run `deformetrica estimate model.xml data_set.xml -p optimization_parameters.xml [--output outdirectory]`
    - Model results will be saved by default in an output folder, please add an output flag to specificy directory 
    - Using CUDA? refer to deformetrica's [page](https://gitlab.com/icm-institute/aramislab/deformetrica/-/wikis/3_user_manual/3.8_performance).

#### 5. Analyze morphing results
The model will provide you with a series of files:
    - The estimated template: DeterministicAtlas_EstimatedParameters_Template.vtk
    - The location of the control points: DeterministicAtlas__EstimatedParameters__ControlPoints.txt
    - The momenta for each object: DeterministicAtlas__EstimatedParameters__Momenta.txt
    - The residuals of the fit: DeterministicAtlas__EstimatedParameters__Residuals.txt
    - A series of 20 vtk files for each subject, progressing from the the template shape to the individual shape: DeterministicAtlas_Flow_object_subject_samplename_0.vtk -> DeterministicAtlas_Flow_object_subject_samplename_19.vtk 

For a first look at how well the morphing worked, open up the vtk files from 0 to 19 for a subject in Paraview. Paraview usually automatically groups files in a series together, so jut press the 'play' button to watch the morphing progress.

Alternatively, you can look at the final morphing shape for each sample (file ending in 19) and see how well that fits to real data.


### File Structure
To use the code as formatted, data files are expected to organized in a 'data' folder in the following way. The segmentations and landmarks folders are only required if using the `align.py` function. Otherwise only the a series of mesh files need in the mesh folder. 

```
data
|
|---segmentations
|   |  sample01.nii.gz
|   |  sample0n.nii.gz
|
|---landmarks
|   |  sample01.mps
|   |  sample0n.mps
|   
|---mesh
|   |  sample01.vtk
|   |  sample0n.vtk
```
